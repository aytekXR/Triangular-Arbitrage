        Calculates the triangular arbitrage score based on provided exchange rates.
        
        This method attempts to calculate the arbitrage opportunity by executing a series of trades
        starting with one currency and converting it through a series of others back to the original,
        aiming to end up with more than started with.

        rates (dict): A dictionary where keys are currency pair strings and values are the exchange rates.
        
        Returns:
        float: The result of the triangular arbitrage calculation, which is a score indicating 
               the profitability of the arbitrage if greater than 1. 
               Returns False if there's a KeyError (missing currency pair) or ZeroDivisionError.
